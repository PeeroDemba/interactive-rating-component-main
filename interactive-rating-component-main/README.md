## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- SASS
- Flexbox

### What I learned

This project tested me on how to display user selection without a database. It was alittle bit hectic as this was the fisrt time i have ever implemented something like this. But ultimately, i figured it out in a few hours.

### Continued development

I will keep building more dynamic projects with JavaScript so as to be fully able to implement any websites frontend.
