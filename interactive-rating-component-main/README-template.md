## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- SASS
- Flexbox

### What I learned

This project tested me on how to display user selection without a database. It was alittle bit hectic as this was the fisrt time i have ever implemented something like this. But ultimately, i figured it out in a few hours.

### Continued development

I will keep building more dynamic projects with JavaScript so as to be fully able to implement any websites frontend.

Questions:
I successfully completed the project but i have a few questions:
- Should i have used the FORM element to implement the rating buttons.
-  If yes, how can i extract an integer number from the form using JavaScript so as to display the result on the Thank You page. I feel this will help me verify that the user/client has made a selection as the current method does not offer that.
